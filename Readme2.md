Hello guys concerning the discussion i had on our telegram group.

In other to keep the project light and time saving, i came up with the following idea listed bellow.

.We start buy creating a Transportation token since the project is based on a Decentralized transportation system,
the use case of this token is to enable users book means of transportation depending on where the project would be 
applied e.g : train station, cab services (uber etc), biking. e.t.c...

.Create a "Buy and sell Token" page where users can buy and sell the Transportation token (TTC) with other crypto asset on the Bsc network e.g BNB,BUSD...

.Create a "Book Transportation" Page where users can use their available (TTC) to book means of transportation e.g Train...

.Also we create a home page which would have links to the other pages ("Book transportation" page and "Buy and sell Token" Page).

. We make use of users BSC wallet to replace sign up and sign in function since we are dealing with decentralization.

So guys this is what i am proposing, i also shared the UI design on our telegram group which i will be attaching here on github thanks.
